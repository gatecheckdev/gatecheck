Gatecheck automates report validation in a CI/CD Pipeline by comparing security findings to pre-determined thresholds.
It also provides report aggregation, artifact integrity, and deployment validation.
Gatecheck is stateless so self-hosting and provisioning servers is not required.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to get started with Gatecheck is to download the pre-built binaries for your target system.

```shell
cd <target install dir>
curl -L <OS Specific Release>.tar.gz | tar xz
./gatecheck
./gatecheck --help
```

The Gatecheck CLI supports ```--help``` for every command for more detail usage.

Generate a configuration file with the default thresholds set

```shell
gatecheck config init > gatecheck.yaml
```

### Summarize Reports with List

```shell
gatechec ls --help
```

List with EPSS Scores is support for Grype and Cyclondex reports
