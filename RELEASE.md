# Release Instructions

Releasing is done by maintainers with permissions to bypass the PR only rule.
By pushing a tag to the main repository, the release action is triggered which
packages the app and releases it to the GitHub UI.

1. Run `task upgrade` to update dependencies and tidy modules
1. Run `task test` to make sure unit testing still passes after upgrading
1. Commit the changes `git commit -am "chore: upgrade dependencies"`
1. Update CHANGELOG.md
1. Release commit (optional) `git commit -m "release: vx.x.x && git push`
1. Release tag `git tag -s -a vX.X.X -m "Release version X.X.X"`
1. git push tag `git push vX.X.X`
